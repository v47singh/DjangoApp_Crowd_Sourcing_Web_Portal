## Project Proposal: Crowdsourcing Web Portal for Video Quality Data Collection

### Background:
Image and Vision Computing(IVC) Lab lead by Prof. Zhou Wang in ECE Department is  working on a vision to make better perceptual video and image quality assessment models. To succeed in their vision, lab wants to create a huge video quality feedback database through crowdsourcing. Our project’s aim is to develop web portal for the lab to collect this data more efficiently and at reduced cost.

### Scope:
<ul>
<li>	To create UI  for subjective human experiment(showing videos and collecting feedback)</li>
 <li> To create backend module interacting with frontend, database(videos and feedback score) and score aggregator module.</li>
<li>	Implement an active learning based algorithm to select a set of videos(~10 videos) from a huge database of videos(~Million) in such a way that least number of experiments will be required to gather maximum information.</li>
</ul>

### Objectives:
In this project we would like to achieve the following objectives:
<ul>
<li>	 Understand the Agile Software development process by adopting  the underlying principles in the project. </li>
<li>	Get familiar with Full-Stack Web Development, which includes learning about different technologies and frameworks used in the making of a website.</li>
<li>	Specifically, we would like to work with the following technology stacks:
<ul>
    		<li>Front End: HTML/CSS, JavaScript Bootstraps</li>
    		<li>Backend: Django/Postgresql / Amazon S3 </li>
    		<li>Project Management Tools:  GitLab </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
